# COXEN
An implementation of the COXEN (Co-expression extrapolation) algorithm in Python. This was originally implemented in our lab (Gustafson lab at the Animal Cancer Center @ CSU) in R by Jared Fowles based on the description from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2831138/ which predicts patient survival based on gene expression. I expanded on the R implementation, automating certain parts, testing additional statistical models (including some machine learning models) and creating the "reverse" implmentation (choosing a chemotherapy based on gene expression). 

This repository contains an implementation of COXEN in Python based on my original R scripts (also uploaded). The purpose being to update the implementation (should run faster) and to make the code more reusable, as this was mainly used in just our lab and I am unable to find the original creator's implementation online, and to practice Python.
