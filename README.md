# COXEN
An implementation of the COXEN (Co-expression extrapolation) algorithm in Python & R. This was originally implemented in our lab (Gustafson lab at the Animal Cancer Center @ CSU) in R by Jared Fowles based on the description from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2831138/ which predicts patient survival based on gene expression. I expanded on the R implementation, automating certain parts, testing additional statistical models (including some machine learning models) and creating the "reverse" implmentation (choosing a chemotherapy based on gene expression). 

This repository contains an implementation of COXEN in R with some of the original scripts, still to be worked through. The purpose of this repository being to update the implementation in both R and Python to improve efficiency, to make the code more reusable, as this was mainly used in just our lab and I am unable to find the original creator's implementation online, and to practice Python & R.  

Currently the Python implementation is not started. Cleaning up the R version will likely happen first as the implementation is much easier to create in R.
